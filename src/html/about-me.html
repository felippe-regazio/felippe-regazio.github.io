  <p class="descr">
    Howdy! My name is Felippe Regazio, I'am a passionate software developer focused in Front End Development. 
    I grew up on the internet trying my first lines of code at 14. So, I'm mostly a self-taught developer. 
    I usually write code for large apps with mixed stacks and high traffic volume as content portals, software 
    as a service, customized CMS, chatbots and AI assistents - I worked and collaborated with companies 
    like Sitel, Havaianas BR-USA, HBO, Dell, mLabs and many others. I believe in software development 
    as a creative and social-driven profession, once every software is a tool focused on a community and its 
    context. I believe in hard work, study, creativity and method as ingredients to deliver the best possible results.
