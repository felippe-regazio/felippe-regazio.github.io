  <p class="descr">
    I'm a passionate software developer focused in Front End development. 
    I grew up on the internet, trying my first lines of code at 14. So, I'm 
    mostly a self-taught developer. I worked moastly with large products and 
    high traffic volume pages as content portals, software as a service, 
    customized CMS - having worked and collaborated with companies like TSC 
    International Agency, NÃ¼rnberg Messe Brazil, Apargatas (Havaianas) and 
    mLabs. I believe in software development as a creative and social-driven 
    profession, once every software is a tool focused on a community and its 
    context. I believe in hard work, study, creativity and method as 
    ingredients to deliver the best possible results.
